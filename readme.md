# NebulasNodeMonitor
A service tool to check the status of a Nebulas.io node and intervene if necessary.

This repo is a work in progress and I am still working on the code and testing. It's not ready for real world usage at the moment. 
In the future, I would like to support notifications via Telegram & email as well as a web-based GUI with stored node stats.
